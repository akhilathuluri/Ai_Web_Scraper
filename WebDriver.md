## üîë Getting Your SBR_WEBDRIVER

Before installing the project, you'll need to set up your Bright Data Scraping Browser. Here's how to get your SBR_WEBDRIVER:

1. **Create a Bright Data Account**
   - Visit [Bright Data's website](https://brightdata.com/)
   - Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account

2. **Navigate to Scraping Browser**
   - Go to your Bright Data dashboard
   - Select "Scraping Browser" from the products menu

3. **Create a New Proxy**
   - Click on "Create new proxy"
   - Choose "Scraping Browser" as your proxy type
   - Select your target websites or choose "All websites"

4. **Configure Your Proxy**
   - Set up your proxy zone name (e.g., "my-scraping-zone")
   - Choose your target countries if needed
   - Configure any additional settings like session duration

5. **Get Your SBR_WEBDRIVER URL**
   - After creating the proxy, go to the "Integration" tab
   - Look for the "Selenium" integration section

     ```
     https://[username]:[password]@brd.superproxy.io:9515/wd/hub
     ```
